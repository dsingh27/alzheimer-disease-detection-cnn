# Diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease with Convolutional Neural Networks using MRI Data

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory and other cognitive abilities, leading
to a decline in daily function. The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial in providing effective treatment
and care for patients. Early detection can prevent the patient from further damage to the brain cells and hence
avoid permanent memory loss. In the past few years, various automatic tools and techniques have been proposed
for the diagnosis of AD. Several methods focus on fast, accurate, and early detection of the disease to minimize the
loss of a patient’s mental health. Although machine learning and deep learning techniques have significantly
improved medical imaging systems for AD by providing diagnostic performance close to the human level. Many
kinds of brain abnormalities cause changes in different parts of the brain. Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic condition
that degenerates the cells of the brain, leading to memory asthenia. With the advancement of technology today, it
is possible to detect Alzheimer’s disease through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. So that MRI is the
technique most often used for the diagnosis and analysis of the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. With this
technology, image recognition for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can be achieved automatically using
machine learning.
This study is aimed at recognizing the presence of Alzheimer's disease based on magnetic resonance imaging of
the brain. We adopted a deep learning methodology for the discrimination between AD (Alzheimer's disease), CN
(Cognitively Normal), and MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) patients from 2D slices collected using magnetic
resonance imaging. Most of the previous research was based on the implementation of a 3D convolutional neural
network, whereas we incorporated the usage of 2D slices as input to the convolutional neural network. The data
set for this research was obtained from the ADNI website. We trained the convolutional neural network structure
using the 2D slices to build the CNN and ResNet 50 models to detect the early stage of AD.
